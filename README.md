The application is optimized for the `Pixel 5 screen size (1080 x 2340 pixels)`. When running on a smaller screen, it may experience issues where the bottom navigation bar partially covers some of the content. Therefore, it is recommended to use the app on devices with the `Pixel 5` screen size to ensure optimal display and navigation, avoiding potential issues where the bottom navigation bar may cover some of the content on smaller screens.
